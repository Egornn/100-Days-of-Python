    <h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-times</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Scott Pilgrim vs The World</h3>
    <p>This is my favourite film. It has a great story, cast, story and visuals. Highly recommended.</p>
    <h3>Inside Job</h3>
    <p>This is an unfortunetelly short series about a world in which every single conspiracy theory is real..</p>
    <h3>Fullmetal Alchemist</h3>
    <p>An amazing story with a great pacing and high stakes. One of (if not the) best anime of all times</p>
